When opening a new project for the first time, you will see the Default Layout.

This layout provides the most common windows used and in a configuration good for smaller screens. Additional windows can be added through the Window menu in the taskbar.

The windows of the default layout are as follows:

## **Hierarchy Window**

This window shows a text list of game objects within your scene.
