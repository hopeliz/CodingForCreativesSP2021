# Modifiers

Something that might make coding easier is to find shortcuts to represent code to set things such as coordinates where one coordinate is a 1 or -1. Then, to change the one value, multiply the variable or shortcut by a modifier. 

We'll do this often with a `speed` variable in different class activities.

Here are the 3D shortcuts for Unity:

| Shortcut         | Equivalent          |
| ---------------- | ------------------- |
| `Vector3.up`     | `Vector3(0, 1, 0)`  |
| `Vector3.down`   | `Vector3(0, -1, 0)` |
| `Vector3.left`   | `Vector3(-1, 0, 0)` |
| `Vector3.right`  | `Vector3(1, 0, 0)`  |
| `Vector3.foward` | `Vector3(0, 0, 1)`  |
| `Vector3.back`   | `Vector3(0, 0, -1)` |

These can be multiplied and divided as an easy way to adjust the value on just one axis.
