# Arrays

**Arrays** are multiple pieces of data stored in a single variable. Basically, a** list**. 

They are sometimes pictured as a one-column table with multiple rows.

Use an array where you’d use a list \- shopping list, items in a bag, attendee list, etc.

You can also use them where you’d use a table \- contact information, recipe ingredients, statistics, etc.
