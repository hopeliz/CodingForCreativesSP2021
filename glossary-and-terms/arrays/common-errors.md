# Common Errors

## Out-of-Bounds Error&#xD;

This is what you’ll get when trying to access an element, “slot,” or index that doesn’t exist.

### &#xD;Quick fix:&#xD;

1. Print the length of an array:

```java
println(arrayName.length);
```

2\. Make sure the index you are trying to access is LESS THAN the length.
