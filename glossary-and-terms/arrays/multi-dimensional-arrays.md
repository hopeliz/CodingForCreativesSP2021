# Multi-Dimensional Arrays

## Multi-Dimensional Arrays

Arrays inside arrays \(array-ception or “Yo, Dawg, I heard you like arrays, so I put an array inside your array” array\)

Think of these like tables or matrices with multiple columns.

They have two indices per element \(like coordinates - row, column\)

## Creating Two-Dimensional Arrays

Two-Dimensional arrays can be created with sets of initial values listed within curly brackets **`{ }`**, then list these sets within outer curly brackets **`{ }`**

Double square brackets **`[ ][ ]`** are placed right after the data type for all the elements of an array to signify it as a two-dimensional array.

Examples:

_Processing:_

```java
// First and Last name and of 5 people
String[][] people = { 
    { "Charles", "Stanton" }, 
    { "Eric", "Straub" }, 
    { "Ellie", "Aderyn" },
    { "Betty", "Dean" },
    { "Alex", "Heber" }
};
```

How to picture it:

| people | 0 | 1 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 0 | "Charles" | "Stanton" |
| 1 | "Eric"         | "Straub"                                                                                                                        |
| 2 | "Ellie" | "Aderyn" |
| 3 | "Betty" | "Dean" |
| 4 | "Alex" | "Heber" |

## Using Two-Dimensional Arrays

Now, the elements can be accessed by their indices using both row and column.

Examples:

_Processing:_

```java
println(people[0][0] + " " + people[0][1]);
 
// Prints "Charles Stanton"
```

## Updating Two-Dimensional Arrays

Each “cell” can be updated individually like any other variable.

Examples:

_Processing:_

```java
people[0][0] = "Charlie";

println(people[0][0] + " " + people[0][1]);
 
// Prints "Charlie Stanton"
```
