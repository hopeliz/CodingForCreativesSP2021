# Declaring Variables

**Declaring** is another way of saying creating a variable.

## **Explicit vs. Implicit**

### **Explicit or “strict”**

* type is specified when the variable is created

A line of code looks like:

_Processing, Java-based, and C-based example:_

```java
type variableName;
```

### **Implicit or “loose”**

* type is assumed

A line of code looks like:

_JavaScript example:_

```javascript
var variableName;
```

or

_Python example:_

```python
variablename = 0
```

## Naming Conventions

### **Camel Casing**

* No Spaces
* Starts lowercase
* Starting with the second word, each word starts with a capital letter

**Examples:**   `highScore`    `numPlayers`    `objectToDisappear`

### **Pascal Casing**

* No Spaces
* Starts with an uppercase letter
* Each word starts with a capital letter
* Often used for functions and methods

**Examples:**   `HighScore`    `NumPlayers`    `ObjectToDisappear`

### **All Upper Case**

* No Spaces
* Spaces are replaced by underscores \( `_` \)
* Often used for constant variables

**Examples:**   `HIGH_SCORE`    `NUM_PLAYERS`   ****`OBJECT_TO_DISAPPEAR`
