# Using a Variable

After declaring and assigning the variable, you only need to use the variable name.\
\
Place the name where you will use it instead of a value and before the end of the line.

**Examples:**

_Processing and Java-based example:_

```java
String name = "Chuck";

println("Your name is " + name + "! Hello, " + name + ".");

// The above line would print "Your name is Chuck! Hello, Chuck."
```

_C# example:_

```csharp
string name = "Chuck";

print("Your name is " + name + "! Hello, " + name + ".");

// The above line would print "Your name is Chuck! Hello, Chuck."
```

_Python example:_

```python
name = "Chuck"
print("Your name is " + name + "! Hello, " + name + ".")

# The above line would print "Your name is Chuck! Hello, Chuck."
```
