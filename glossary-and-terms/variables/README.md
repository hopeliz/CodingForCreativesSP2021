# Variables

Variables are pieces of reusable information

They have **names** and **values**. The variable is the placeholder for its value.

You can...

[...declare or create a variable](declaring-variables.md)

[...assign a variable a value](assigning-a-variable.md)

[...use a variable](using-a-variable.md)

[...create and use variables with different data types](data-types/)

[...cast or change one data type into another data type](casting-a-variable.md)
