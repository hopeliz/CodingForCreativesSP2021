# Mathematical Operators

You can do math equations with these operators:

|  | Operator | Example\(s\) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| add | `+` | `x = 2 + 3;  // x is now 5` |
| subtract | `-` | `y = 6 - 9;  // y is now -3` |
| multiply | `*` | `z = 5 * 3;  // z is now 15` |
| divide | `/` | `a = 9 / 3;  // a is now 3` |
| modulus / remainder | `%` | `b = 4 % 3;  // b is now 1` |
| exponent | `^` | `c = 3^3;    // c is now 27` |

These operators, followed by an equals sign is a shortcut to adjusting the variable:

|  | Operator | Example\(s\)    let's say x = 3 in all cases |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| add this | `+=` | `x += 3;    // x is now 6` |
| subtract this | `-=` | `x -= 9;    // x is now -6` |
| multiply this by | `*=` | `x *= 3;    // x is now 9` |
| divide this by | `/=` | `x /= -1;   // x is now -3` |
| modulus / remainder of this | `%=` | `x %= 2;    // x is now 1` |
| exponent of this | `^=` | `x ^= 3;    // x is now 27` |
