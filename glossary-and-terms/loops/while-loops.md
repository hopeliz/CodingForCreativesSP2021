# While Loops

Runs while the conditions following “while” are true - possibly forever!

To “break” out of the loop, update a “control variable” in the loop so eventually the conditions will be false

## While loop example

**Processing, Java, C\#:**

```java
int count = 0;

while (count < 5) {
    println(count);
    count++;
}
```

**JavaScript and JS libraries:**

```javascript
var count = 0;

while (count < 5) {
    println(count);
    count++;
}
```

Both will print:

> 0  
> 1  
> 2  
> 3  
> 4

Here:

1. Type: while **\(line 3\)**
2. Initialization: int count = 0; and var count = 0;   **\(line 1\)**
3. Conditions: \(count &lt; 5\)  **\(line 3\)**      \(only runs the loop code when the count is 0-4\)
4. Update: count++;   **\(line 5\)**
5. Action: println\(count\);   **\(line 4\)**  \(prints the current value of count\)
