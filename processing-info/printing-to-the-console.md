# Printing to the Console

You can "print" or display messages in the console with the following code:

Line of text:

```java
print("Hello!");  
```

Prints:

> Hello!

Multiple "strings" of text on ONE line:

```java
print("Hello, ");  
print("y'all!");
```

Prints:

> Hello, y'all!

Line of text with a carriage return at the end:

```java
println("Hello!");  
```

Prints:

> Hello!

Multiple "strings" of texts showing the difference between `print()` and `println()`

```java
print("Hello, ");  
println("y'all!");
print("I'm happy to see you.");
```

Prints:

> Hello, y'all!  
> I'm happy to see you.

You can also "concatenate" or connect strings with a plus \(`+`\) sign:

```java
println("Hello, " + "y'all!");
println("I'm happy to" + " see you.");
```

Prints:

> Hello, y'all!  
> I'm happy to see you.
