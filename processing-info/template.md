# Template

Most, if not all your Processing projects will have the following code (except for different sizes for your canvas). 

Without a set canvas size, a default one will appear.

```java
// Runs once on first frame
void setup() { 
    size(400, 400);          // Creates a 400 x 400 pixel canvas
}


// Runs every frame
void draw() {

}
```

This is helpful to copy and paste if you don't want to type it each time.
