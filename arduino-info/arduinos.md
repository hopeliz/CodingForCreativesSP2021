# Arduinos!

## Getting Started

Download the Arduino IDE (similar to Processing) here:

{% embed url="https://www.arduino.cc/en/software" %}

Next, set up your Arduino and components. Check out the parts and setup sections for descriptions of the parts, diagrams, and code for set up.

{% content-ref url="the-parts.md" %}
[the-parts.md](the-parts.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="the-setup/" %}
[the-setup](the-setup/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

The Setup section also provides info about:

{% content-ref url="the-setup/using-the-serial-connection.md" %}
[using-the-serial-connection.md](the-setup/using-the-serial-connection.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

This serial connection is needed to upload your code to the Arduino and you can use it to see data coming in from sensors.
